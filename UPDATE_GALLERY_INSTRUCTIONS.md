## 📝 How to Update the Gallery

### Step 1: Open index.html

Find this line (around line 2867):
```html
<div class="gallery-filters mb-4">
```

### Step 2: Replace Gallery Content

Replace everything from `<div class="gallery-filters mb-4">` 
until just before `</div>` (before the closing container div of the gallery section)

With the content from: **`gallery_generated.html`**

### Step 3: Update the JavaScript

The gallery filter JavaScript needs to be updated to handle categories instead of types.

I'll update this automatically for you!

### Step 4: Add Enhanced CSS

I'll add beautiful hover effects and animations automatically!
